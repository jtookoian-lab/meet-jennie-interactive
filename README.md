# Meet Jennie 👋  
### An Interactive Enablement Experience

This project is an intentionally playful way to introduce how I think about **enablement, learning design, and audience engagement**.

Rather than listing credentials, I built an experience that mirrors how I design field programs:  
learner-first, conversation-driven, and grounded in learning science.

## 🎮 What This Is

**Meet Jennie** is an interactive memory game.  
Each successful match unlocks a conversation starter—designed not as trivia, but as a prompt for meaningful dialogue.

The goal isn’t to “win” the game.  
The goal is to **start better conversations**.

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

This experience reflects how I approach enablement work:

- **Adult Learning Science**  
  - Retrieval practice  
  - Engagement through play  
  - Motivation via progress and feedback

- **Field Enablement Mindset**  
  - Conversation starters over content dumps  
  - Stories over stats  
  - Application over consumption

- **Product & UX Thinking**  
  - Clear affordances  
  - Feedback loops (score, speed bonus, progress)  
  - Lightweight, intuitive interaction

- **Technical Fluency (Without Over-Engineering)**  
  - Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript  
  - Designed to be simple, portable, and easy to evolve

## 🎯 Why a Game?

In enablement, engagement is never accidental.

I’ve found that people remember:
- what surprised them,
- what made them smile,
- and what invited them into the conversation.

This game is a small example of how I design experiences that do exactly that.

Every match unlocks a prompt designed to spark a conversation.  
I’d love to continue one of those in real life.
