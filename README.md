# Meet Jennie
### An Interactive Enablement Experience

This project is an intentionally playful way to introduce how I think about **enablement, learning design, and audience engagement**.

Rather than listing credentials, I built an experience that mirrors how I design field programs: 
learner-first, conversation-driven, and grounded in learning science.

## What This Is

**Meet Jennie** is an interactive categorization game. 
Instead of a static resume, you are presented with career milestones that function as **conversation starters**. 

As you sort these milestones into their correct categories—**The "How" (Skills)**, **The "Where" (Experience)**, and **The "Proof" (Results)**—you "unlock" them as topics for our future dialogue.

The goal isn't just to sort the cards correctly. 
The goal is to **curate a better conversation**.

## What This Demonstrates

This experience reflects how I approach enablement work:

* **Adult Learning Science**
    * **Active Categorization:** Engaging the brain to organize information rather than passively reading a list.
    * **Feedback Loops:** Instant validation through "Topic Unlocked" badges and progress tracking.
    * **Gamification with Purpose:** Using play to lower the barrier to engagement and increase information retention.

* **Field Enablement Mindset**
    * **Conversations over Content:** Shifting the focus from "what I've done" to "what we should talk about."
    * **Strategic Structure:** Organizing the "How," "Where," and "Proof" to show a complete GTM (Go-To-Market) picture.

* **Product & UX Thinking**
    * **Clear Affordances:** Intuitive drag-and-drop mechanics.
    * **Modern Interaction:** Designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to evolve.

* **Technical Fluency**
    * Built with a focus on portability and clean interaction using modern web standards (Tailwind CSS, JavaScript).

## Why This Format?

In Enablement, engagement is never accidental.

I’ve found that people remember:
1.  What surprised them.
2.  What made them smile.
3.  What invited them into the conversation.

By turning my background into a game of discovery, I'm inviting you to be an active participant in my career story rather than just a reader.

## Want to Go Deeper?

Every milestone you "unlocked" in the game is a prompt I'm ready to discuss. I’d love to dive into the details of those "Results" or the "How" behind my strategy in real life.
